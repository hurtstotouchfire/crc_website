title: "Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative"
---

The **Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative (CRC)** is a group of scientists in the Boston area who work together to advance our understanding of the brain dynamics underlying cognitive functions such as sensory processing, attention, learning, memory and motor planning.
  
The members of the CRC come from multiple institutions around the Boston area and beyond (see [Faculty]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}people/faculty/)). We encourage those who are interested in working with us or participating in our events to contact Nancy Kopell (nk at bu.edu).

The CRC is supported by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.org) and the [McGovern Center](http://mcgovern.mit.edu).
