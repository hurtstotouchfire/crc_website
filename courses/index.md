<b>BU MA665: Introduction to Modeling and Data Analysis in Neuroscience. (Kramer).</b> 2-credit course for intro neurosci students.  Topics include:  basic spike train analysis, basic computational models of spiking, the Hodgkin-Huxley model of spiking, an introduction to Fourier series, and an introduction to networks.  Meets twice a week, with one lecture and one computer lab.

<b>BU MA 568 Statistical Analysis of Point Process Data. (Eden).</b>  Introduces the theory of point processes and develops practical problem-solving skills to construct models, assess goodness-of-fit, and perform estimation from point process data. 
</p><p>
<b>HST.576 Topics in Neural Signal Processing (Brown).</b>  Focuses on signal processing methods for the analysis of stochastic dynamical systems in neuroscience.  Includes state-space methods and dynamic Baysian methods applied to continuous and point process observations.
