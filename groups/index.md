* Dynamics in hippocampus</li>
* Synthesis and modeling of current results in hippocampus research</li>

## Sleep & Memory
* Led by Charmaine Demanuelle and Bengi Baran</li>
* Brain oscillations during sleep that are critical for learning and memory and how they may go awry in neurological/psychiatric disorders</li>
