### Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging and the Psychiatric Neuroimaging Division of the Psychiatry Department at Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA

Project: Development of accelerated diffusion and functional MRI scans with real-time motion tracking for children with autism  
PI: Dara S. Manoach, Ph.D.  
[Manoach Lab](http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/manoachlab)

Our team is developing several technical innovations that will significantly reduce the impact of head motion on fMRI and diffusion data.  We are seeking a candidate to work with us to improve data analysis by making fMRI and diffusion analysis motion-aware using both the in-image data and the motion tracking data.

The Research Fellow will be expected to:

1. Assist with setting up the data acquisition to ensure that the protocols are well-designed for the analysis questions;
2. Build motion-aware processing tools that work in concert with existing software packages to improve the analysis of fMRI and DWI data;
3. Assist in the processing, interpretation and analysis of the results of both phantom and human studies; and
4. Apply these methods to address clinical research questions in autism.

Our ideal candidate has a PhD in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related fields, and has experience in signal processing and numerical methods. Candidates with experience in image processing and time series analysis, or specifically in fMRI and diffusion data analysis will be preferred. This position requires strong programming skills, and the candidate is expected to have experience working in C++, scripting languages (e.g., Python), and rapid-prototyping languages for numerical algorithms (e.g., Matlab, Mathematica). Strong communication skills are essential, as the position involves working with an interdisciplinary team of scientists in both MRI physics/engineering and psychology/neuroscience in addition to research coordinators and MRI technologists.  Background in cognitive neuroscience and an interest in clinical applications are advantageous.  Training in clinical research will be provided.

Position available immediately.  Please send:

* CV
* statement of post-doctoral and career goals
* writing sample (e.g., a published manuscript)
* letters and/or contact information for three references
